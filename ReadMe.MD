#   Quinoa Quality Inspection-NDA

The current repository contains the convolutional classification model for the detection of Quinoa grain quality. Within it you will find different documents such as the model code 'model_quinoa.ipynb', as well as the real time application in the code 'quinoa.py'. 
To run the model and the code in real time do not forget to check the libraries document to make sure that you have all the necessary libraries downloaded on your machine. 
Once you are able to run the model you can download it in .h5, unfortunately this downloaded model cannot be uploaded to this platform due to its current weight.
With the .h5 downloaded you can paste its corresponding path in the 'quinoa.py' code to make the predictions in real time!
We believe that the model can be optimized, as well as its real-time embedded application. This can be improved with the addition of boxes on the screen in real time, in order to make the predictions more understandable.
